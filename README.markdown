# What is this?

You can view the live app here: [http://sleepy-coast-8211.herokuapp.com](http://sleepy-coast-8211.herokuapp.com).

This is a simple app that tells you the correct amount (by weight) of coffee to water according the SCAA guidelines.

I made this so that I'd have access to this handy calculator as long as I have web access.

As a bonus, there is a timer in case you need one to time your brew.
